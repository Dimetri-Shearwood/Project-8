# Mortal Kombat new comers

## About this app

Who do you want to see in the next Mortal Kombat?  This app is a database of ideas.  You can see who we want there, add your own suggestions, and because security wasn't in the scope of this project, you can edit or delete any fighter you want!  Knock yourself out.

## Technologies used

This is a MERN stack project, so we used Mongo, Express JS, React JS, and Node JS. We also used the CSS framework Bulma for styling. We used github for collaboration and versioni control.
